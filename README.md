Overview:
This Python-based keylogger project, undertaken for Pinnacle Labs, is designed to capture keyboard input, providing insights into active tab/window text even when websites employ the "hide password" feature.

Features:
Stealth Mode: Operates discreetly in the background.
Windows API Integration: Utilizes the Windows API for seamless functionality.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Developed to run on various Windows environments.
